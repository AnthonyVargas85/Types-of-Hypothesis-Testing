# Types-of-Hypothesis-Testing
An A/B test where half of users were shown a green submit button and the other half were shown a purple submit button. Was one group more likely to click the submit button? Men and women were both given a survey asking "Which of the following three products is your favorite?" Did the men and women have significantly different preferences? In SciPy, you can use the function chi2_contingency to perform a Chi Square test.  The input to chi2_contingency is a contingency table where:  The columns are each a different condition, such as men vs. women or Interface A vs. Interface B The rows represent different outcomes, like "Survey Response A" vs. "Survey Response B" or "Clicked a Link" vs. "Didn't Click" This table can have as many rows and columns as you need.  In this case, the null hypothesis is that there's no significant difference between the datasets. We reject that hypothesis, and state that there is a significant difference between two of the datasets if we get a p-value less than 0.05.
